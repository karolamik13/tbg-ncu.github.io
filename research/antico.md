### ANTICO
Antibodies against pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 are promising candidates for effective drugs [1]. However,
their direct application is hampered by difficulty in lab production of these complex molecules. Recently much
attention is devoted to nanobodies - single-domain antibodies that can be effectively produced using molecular
biology techniques. Effective screening of nanobodies gave systems with sub-picomolar affinity SARS type viruses
Using computational strategy called Virtual Atomic Force Microscopy, we study the nanobody-protein S stability. Using cryo-EM structures of Nb6 nanobodies bound
to closed and open SpikeS2P protein, we apply Steered Molecular Dynamics to assess unbinding forces and to
determine molecular mechanisms of binding-unbinding processes. Our approach is effective and should allow for
efficient ranking of synthetic nanobodies affinities to protein S. Notably, our computations “automatically” indicated
a residue exploited by the Nature to create new, more aggressive variants of SARS viruses.
