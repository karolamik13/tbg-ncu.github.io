### ANTICO
Antibodies against pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 are promising candidates for effective drugs [1]. However,
their direct application is hampered by difficulty in lab production of these complex molecules. Recently much
attention is devoted to nanobodies - single-domain antibodies that can be effectively produced using molecular
biology techniques. Effective screening of nanobodies gave systems with sub-picomolar affinity to SARS type viruses.
Using computational strategy develped "in-house", called Virtual Atomic Force Microscopy,
we study stabilityof the nanobody-protein S complexes.
Starting from cryo-EM structures of Nb6 nanobodies bound to closed
and open SpikeS2P protein strucutes,
we apply Steered Molecular Dynamics to assess unbinding forces
and to determine molecular mechanisms of binding-unbinding processes.
Our approach is effective, semi-automatic and should allow for
efficient ranking of synthetic nanobodies affinities to protein S.
Notably, our computations ÂautomaticallyÂ indicated a residue exploited
by the Nature to create new, more aggressive variants of SARS viruses.
