### AFM biomechanics

 ![alt tag](/assets/images/afm.jpg)
Experimental biomechanics allows to test mechanical stability of single molecules, cells and tissues. Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is one of main tool in this research and works perfectly in tandem with SMD. 
It enabled to explore DNA mechanics under previously untested high stretching force regime, up to 1.8 nN of possible limit of sugar-phosphate backbone. We observed that if double helix is prohibited from rotation, then a transition is displayed as a small plateau in force vs. distance plot both during stretching and relaxation, at stretching forces approaching 1 nN. This transition was absent when molecules with rotational freedom were stretched, showing thus that underlying mechanism was directly connected with molecule linking number conservation. Such DNA behavior proves, that contrary to previous beliefs DNA duplex is not fully melted after undergoing two transitions reported before and covalent bonds are much more robust than anticipated.
Silk is an exceptionally strong and versatile protein fiber spun by many invertebrates. It is encountered in spider webs as well as pupal cases and cocoons of caterpilars. A significant research was made for better understanding of silk made by land invertebrates. However, silk is also spun by less known aquatic species like caddisfly (Trichoptera), some midges or Agyroneta spider. This silk is optimized for creating and maintaining strong attachment in underwater environment. Thus aquatic spun silk shows great promise as a biomaterial  and it is necessary to better understand its structure and surface adhesion mechanism. AFM is a perfect tool for this task, allowing both dry and wet imaging capability as well as mechanical measurements.
